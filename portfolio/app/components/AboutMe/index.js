              Since I can remember I always loved being <b>creative</b>. As a kid I used to spent hours drawing, painting, doing crafts and more. I used to invest long hours and put a lot of effort in hand-crafting gifts for my loved ones.<br /><br />
              A great influence for me was my family. I was born and raised in an environment surrounded by all kind of art.<br /><br />
              At the beginning of 2009 I started a career I never pictured myself in. From day zero I loved it. It was not olny art, it was applied art. At that point it helped me to understand who I was and, therefore, who I wanted to be: a <b>graphic designer</b>.<br />
            </li>
            <li>
              In 2016 I obtained a bachelor degree in Graphic Design from Universidad Provincial de CÃ³rdoba (Argentina). From 2012, I have successfully designed solutions for print media and the IT industry, including <b>websites, web apps UX/UI , logos, business cards, flyers, banners and brochures</b>. My work experience includes working in an <b>agency</b> and several <b>freelance</b> projects.<br /><br />
              I am <b>passionate, dedicated, hardworking and very responsible</b>. I put a lot of attention to <b>details</b>. My philosophy is to learn something new every day and that can only happen if I'm open to experience <b>new things</b>.
