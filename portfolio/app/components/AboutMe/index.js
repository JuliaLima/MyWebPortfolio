              I do not remember how it all started, but I always liked being <b>creative</b>. As a kid I used to spend hours drawing, painting, doing crafts and dedicating a lot of time and effort to letters or cards I gave to my loved ones.<br /><br />
              I suddenly realized that little by little I stopped doing artistic things so, over time, I forgot that I really like it.<br /><br />
              At the beginning of 2009 I found myself studying a career that had never occurred to me in the previous years but from day zero made me understand who I was and, therefore, who I wanted to be: a <b>graphic designer</b>.<br />

            <li>
              In 2016 I obtained a bachelor degree in Graphic Design from Universidad Provincial de CÃ³rdoba (Argentina). From 2012, I have successfully designed solutions for print media and the IT industry, including <b>websites, web apps UX/UI , logos, business cards, flyers, banners and brochures</b>. My work experience includes working in an <b>agency</b> and several <b>freelance</b> projects.<br /><br />
              I am <b>passionate, dedicated, hardworking and very responsible</b>. I put a lot of attention in <b>details</b>. My life philosophy is to learn something new every day and that can only happen if I'm open to experience <b>new things</b>.
