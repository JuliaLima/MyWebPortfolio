                        <h1>The context</h1>
                        <div class="text-container">It was the end of February 2019 when my manager told me that I was going to start working on an interesting project. As he started explaining it briefly, I realised that it was going to be really fun and challenging, as it was the first big project I was assigned to at Fergus.
                            I quickly got the idea of what was needed, so I started to mock things up as soon as I could. There were a lot of unknowns, but I manage to get a rough idea of its purpose. And this is how this story begins.<br />
                            Oh, and by the way, Fergus is a job management software for trade businesses. Its objective is to help business owners simplify their job by providing full visibility and control over the ongoing state of work.
                            </div>
                    </div>
                    <div id="paragraph">
                        <h1>The problem</h1>
                        <div class="text-container">Fergus customers are still having piles of paper at their desks, between to do lists and government styled forms. Their idea of using Fergus is precisely to decrease the amount of physical documents and have everything in one single place.<br />
                            Checklists are meant to provide the staff with predefined actions or tasks following internal processes to ensure that they are doing the job with the quality that is expected.
                            Regarding forms, compliance is really important for trades companies, mostly for australian customers, and having the ability to gather data is crucial.<br />
                            By implementing these feature, Fergus will gain a better position against the competition, decrease churn and obviously improve the stack of options it offers.

                    </div>
                    <div id="paragraph">
                        <h1>My role</h1>
                        <div class="text-container">I was an active member during this project from day one. I was responsible of wireframing, prototyping and defining the interaction design alongside the Head of Product Design. I participated in the 5 days Design Sprint that took place at the very beginning. I also helped write the tasks and attended usability testing sessions carried out by a Senior UX Designer. During the whole process I wrote design specs for developers and support them while implementing it. Finally, I provided design feedback over the testing period.</div>
                    </div>
                    <div id="paragraph">
                        <h1>Design sprint</h1>
                        <div class="text-container">There were a lot of questions around which was the best approach for checklists and forms: are them part of the same feature or they are different? Do we want to attach checklists and forms to every object inside Fergus? Are there different categories? Do they trigger other actions when completed? and so on. At this point, there were a lot of assumptions and unknowns, so a Design Sprint (created by Google Ventures in 2010) was scheduled.<br />
                            The group attending was integrated by members of different departments within Fergus, from the product, support, marketing and design team. We sat down on a meeting room from Monday to Friday in order to answer all the questions we had.<br /></div>

                            <div class="text-container">At the end of the week, we managed to test the prototype both internal and externally - two sales representatives from Fergus and two real users. The feedback showed us that we were on the right track but that we should investigate more in some very specific aspects.</div>
                    </div>
                    <div id="paragraph">
                        <h1>Just checklists</h1>
                        <div class="text-container">During April, our main focus was to generate a solution that covers most of the must-have that the Product Manager and the Head of Product Design defined. But from every meeting we had, we always got to the same point: are forms and checklists part of the same feature?. A workshop was immediately scheduled as soon as these undefined questions began to block our work. As a result, we were finally able to reach a very good understanding and therefore a good justification to separate them.<br />
                            Checklist are meant to establish procedures to be replicated across the jobs, whilst forms are destined to gather information for different purposes. This new approach also marked a clear line between the two functionalities and it was possible to reach to something that makes sense from all points of view.</div>
                    </div>
                    <div id="paragraph">
                        <h1>A new beginning</h1>
                        <div class="hero-img"><img src="imgs/cs1-just-checklists.jpg"><br /><h6>Mock-ups from the Design Sprint</h6></div>
                        <div class="text-container">Having achieved this well thought out distinction between functionalities felt like a new beginning of the project. So, at this stage, all the team was able to start focusing in the final solution: checklists.<br />
                            In my case, I worked hard to have a prototype so we can test this approach, while the engineering team began thinking of the end architecture. Alongside this, we started doing weekly stand-ups to share the progress made by each team member. This helped us heaps as it put us in the same page at all times.<br />
                            By the end of March, we had done five usability testing sessions and the feedback obtained was great. Users were very satisfied with what we were proposing. It was then time to focus on the end attributes and the first MVP of the project.</div>
                    </div>
                    <div id="paragraph">
                        <h1>Defining the final solution</h1>
                        <div class="text-container">From April to September was time to iterate until the final version. Yes, it took months, but it makes complete sense due to the level of complexity in the interactions and the fact that we also had to deal with legacy code, user types and its permissions.<br />
                        The basic and most common workflow consists on the business owner or admin person creating a checklist and a worker at the field completing it. On top of this approach, there were management requirements, such as the capability of assigning the whole and/or each task to an employee or group. Another interesting fact of this solution is the panel concept. Users sometimes need to check information from different places at the same time, so it became useful the idea of the checklist in an overlay panel while navigating through pages in the background. Finally, it was mandatory to have access to this feature through the mobile app.</div>

                    <div id="paragraph">
                        <h1>The results</h1>
                        <div class="text-container">Once the engineers had an almost ready prototype, a beta testing period was programmed. Around 10 users got early access to the feature and tested it. The feedback was as expected, questions about the last functionalities that were being implemented during this trial. We also did a short survey in order to know the general feeling, and it was very good.</div>
                        <div class="hero-img"><img src="imgs/cs1-early-access-feedback.svg"><br /><h6>Early access feedback</h6></div>
                        <div class="text-container">We finally launched checklists on October 2019. The adoption rate was good, X% of the total accounts enabled checklists. But the job is not finished yet, we have more iterations to make.</div>
                    </div>
                    <div id="paragraph">
                        <h1>Takeaways</h1>
                        <div class="text-container">It may sound obvious, but I found really helpful having everything well defined after so many unknowns. Trying to design without limitations can become especially hard sometimes.<br />
                            Lastly, the weekly catch-ups with the team made everything so easy! No one felt lost or blocked during the process as we were permanently working side by side.
