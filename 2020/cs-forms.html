                        <div class="text-container">This project is the second part of a bigger one (find out more on <a href="cs-checklists.html">checklists</a>). As a brief introduction, forms and checklists were supposed to be the same project, but after many discussions it was decided that they are different features. Forms are meant to gather information to mainly ensure compliance and standardize processes. As opposed to checklists, which are destined to establish procedures to be replicated across the jobs. Let’s also clarify that Fergus is a job management software for trades businesses.</div>

                        <h1>The problem</h1>
                        <div class="text-container">Fergus customers requested a way to collect information and keep it in the system in the format of a form. They are asked to fill out guvernamental forms to ensure compliance to the established safety parameters in the work they do. On top of that, they are choosing Fergus to leave the paperwork behind by migrating to a cloud based system. This means that they are looking for ways to replicate those physical documents in the software.</div>

                        <div class="text-container">I was involved in the project since the very beginning. I participated in the Design Sprint week and helped by wireframing and prototyping the vision of the feature. Furthermore, it was the first time I conducted usability testing sessions on my own.<br />
                                Being a really complex functionality, my main task was to permanently provide feedback, design specs and updated designs based on our daily discussions to the developers in charge. In the end, I helped during the testing period.

I always try to think about all the different scenarios and use cases, so I get deeply immersed in the project. And forms was one of those projects.
