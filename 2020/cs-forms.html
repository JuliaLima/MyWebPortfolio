                        <div class="text-container">This project is the second part of a bigger one (find out more on <a href="cs-checklists.html">checklists</a>). Let’s also clarify that Fergus is a job management software for trades companies.</div>
                        <div class="text-container">As a brief introduction, forms and checklists were supposed to be the same project, but after many discussions it was decided that they are different features. <span class="highlight">Forms are meant to gather information to mainly ensure compliance and standardize processes</span>. As opposed to checklists, which are destined to establish procedures to be replicated across the jobs.</div>
                    </div>
                    <div id="paragraph">
                        <h1>The problem</h1>
                        <div class="text-container">Fergus customers requested a way to <span class="highlight">collect information</span> and keep it in the system in the format of a form. They are asked to fill out governmental forms to ensure compliance with the established safety parameters in the work they do. On top of that, they are choosing Fergus to leave the paperwork behind by migrating to a <span class="highlight">cloud-based system</span>. This means that they are looking for ways to replicate those physical documents in the software.</div>

                        <h1>My role</h1>
                        <div class="text-container">I was involved in the project since the very beginning. I participated in the Design Sprint week and helped by wireframing and prototyping the vision of the feature. Furthermore, it was the first time <span class="highlight">I conducted usability testing sessions</span> on my own.</div>
                        <div class="text-container">Being a really complex functionality, my main task was to permanently provide feedback, design specs, and updated designs, based on our daily discussions, to the developers in charge. In the end, I helped during the testing period.</div>
                    </div>
                    <div id="paragraph">
                        <h1>Believing in my idea</h1>
                        <div class="text-container"><span class="highlight">I really like it when projects are complicated</span>. I always try to think about all the different scenarios and use cases, so I get deeply immersed in the project. And forms was one of those projects. Everything started around July 2019 while the checklist side of the initial project was being implemented.</div>
                        <div class="text-container">The information gathered during the Design Sprint carried out at the end of March 2019 was enough for me to start designing. I mocked some ideas up in order to have a full picture of the potential feature. It took me a couple of days to think and refine these initial concepts until one day I came up with a really interesting thought: we need to use <span class="highlight">system tags</span>.</div>
                        <div class="text-container">Taking into account what customers are saying in interviews, a common pattern is that they want <span class="highlight">fewer clicks</span>. This led me to think that they need a way to speed up the completion of the form, so we needed to provide them with an <span class="highlight">intelligent system</span>. These tags' goal is to avoid typing those pieces of information that are associated with objects within the app every time you need them.</div>
                        <div class="hero-img"><img src="imgs/cs2-systemtags.jpg"><br /><h6>System tags behaviour</h6></div>
                        <div class="text-container">It was one of those ideas that you fall in love with, but because I was convinced that it was a super useful addition and we had to take the <span class="highlight">opportunity</span>. As soon as I could, I explained the idea to the rest of the team and they agreed with me (yay!), it was going to be a helpful and time-saving functionality for our customers.</div>
                    </div>
                    <div id="paragraph">
                        <h1>Iterations & User Research</h1>
                        <div class="text-container">Because forms are much more complex than checklists, we iterated over and over again. The first workflow that presented a complication was the <span class="highlight">template builder</span>. We are working for not that tech-savvy customers, so we needed to provide a solution that considers their current mental models in order to cause the least possible impact. Something we learned was that users would tend to replicate the exact <span class="highlight">layout</span> of their physical forms because they are used to them.</div>
                        <div class="text-container">We were trying to find a balance between:</div>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Layout agnostic</b> - A form that is going to be filled out in a mobile device, so it’s just one long scrollable column.</li>
                            <li><b>Physical form layout</b> - A form where you can arrange form elements around to save space in an A4 sheet.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <div class="text-container">Our first approach was considering these two facts together. The second was to split the creation of the form and the layout in two different tabs. Lastly, and which is the final solution, we went back and decided that there is definitely no division defined in the mental models of our users as there was for us. We had to understand that it is not necessary to try to be innovative but to be <span class="highlight">progressive</span> in the change.</div>
                        <div class="hero-img"><img src="imgs/cs2-approaches.jpg"><br /><h6>Our three approaches</h6></div>
                        <div class="text-container">To get to these insights, I conducted 4 <span class="highlight">usability testing sessions</span> in person and remotely with customers. I also did 2 more sessions with internal employees so they can share their opinions based on what they know from their roles (an engineer and a sales rep). Once the solution was defined and everyone from the core team was happy about it, I presented it to the whole company on a <span class="highlight">Demo meeting</span>.</div>

                    <div id="paragraph">
                        <h1>Development</h1>
                        <div class="text-container">After the template builder iterations, everything else was easier. Forms are attached to jobs when needed and assigned to employees to ensure they complete and submit them through the <span class="highlight">mobile app</span>.</div>
                        <div class="hero-img"><img src="imgs/cs2-mobile.jpg"><br /><h6>Forms on mobile</h6></div>
                        <div class="text-container">The last stage of the process consisted of supporting the developers by providing assets, detailed behaviors, component states and having interesting discussions around corner cases that arise during this time.</div>
                    </div>
                    <div id="paragraph">
                        <h1>The release</h1>
                        <div class="text-container">Forms MVP is still being implemented. The first milestone is expected to be released in March 2020.</div>

                            <div class="text-container">I think that one of the best things about this project was to <span class="highlight">include the company</span> on the loop. By presenting prototypes and the testing results or the progress made by the engineers, gives the opportunity to obtain more feedback, new ideas, and better involvement.</div>
